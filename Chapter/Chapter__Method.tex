\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{force sb. to do sth. in [形式]} 
    \\ 强迫某人以某种形式做某事 
    \\ \textbf{E.g.} We develop a platoon "strategy" that forces AVs to pass through conflict points in platoons.
    
    \item \textbf{trade-off(v.) between A and B} 
    \\ 在A和B之间权衡 
    \\ \textbf{E.g.} These two algorithms can trade-off between solution quality and computational load.
    
    \item \textbf{In this paper, in order to [achieve goal], we propose to do [experiment process] by [some information]. } 
    \\ 在本文中，为了...，我们提出通过...完成...
    \\ \textbf{E.g.} In this paper, in order to avoid these communication overheads among spatially distributed intersections, we propose to recover the global traffic state at each intersection in a real-time fashion by only utilizing the traffic state observed at the local intersection.
    
    \item \textbf{Specifically, [something unique] base on [some method] is presented to [achieve goal].} 
    \\ 特别的是，基于...的...被展现出来以...
    \\ \textbf{E.g.} Specifically, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based traffic information recovery method is presented for each intersection controller to recover the global traffic state.
